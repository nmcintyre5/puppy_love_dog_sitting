              <p>Welcome to Puppy Love Dog Sitting, where your furry friends receive top-notch care from highly experienced and dedicated dog lovers. We understand the importance of leaving your pets in good hands, which is why we treat them as if they were our own.</p>
              <p>Though we miss our beloved black lab mix dearly, our home is filled with Rover love until we are ready for another furry companion. When you leave your pet with us, expect continuous communication and plenty of adorable photos to keep you updated during your time away.</p>
              <p>Our ideal match is a friendly and loving furry companion who gets along well with humans and other dogs. While we have a soft spot for golden retrievers and labs, we welcome all breeds with open arms.</p>

        <h3>Our Safety Measures:</h3>
        <p>To ensure a safe and comfortable environment, we do meetings in neutral spaces and separate feedings when we have more than one dog with us. They are always carefully monitored, and we have a baby gate to keep them separate as needed (mostly in case of too much fun). To ensure a harmonious pack, we kindly ask that all dogs be spayed or neutered.</p>

            <p>Natalie & Sam are the best, hands down. They always give lots of love and attention to our Hunter, and they're just so easy to communicate with before and during the stay.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m new to the area and feel so lucky to have met Natalie & Sam and have them take care of my five-year-old standard poodle for the weekend. She loved hanging out with them and made herself right at home! I know that I found my second home when needed for travel in the future!</p>
